# Neural_Network_Project


Overview:
  This project is a basic implementation of a neural network in C. It defines the structure of a neural network and demonstrates the training of a single neuron using gradient descent. The aim is to provide a foundational understanding of neural networks and   their implementation in C.

Future Enhancements:
  Extend to multiple neurons and layers.
  Implement more complex training alogirthms and activation functions.
